Elara is a spirited young villager with tangled chestnut hair and bright green eyes that rarely miss a detail. Her boundless curiosity often leads her beyond the village borders.
 While exploring the woods, she discovers a weathered, cryptic mapâ€”its strange symbols stirring something brave and restless within her.
Shadow is a sleek, silver-furred wolf with piercing amber eyes. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he moves silently through the Whispering Woods, sensing danger before it arrives. His keen instincts and protective nature make him an unwavering guardian on her adventurous journey.
