Elara is a spirited young villager with tangled chestnut hair and bright green eyes that rarely miss a detail.
 Her boundless curiosity often leads her beyond the village borders. While exploring the woods, she discovers a weathered,
 cryptic mapâ€”its strange symbols stirring something brave and restless within her.

Shadow is a sleek, silver-furred wolf with piercing amber eyes and a silent, watchful presence. Fiercely loyal to Elara, he moves like mist through the forest, always alert.
 Found as a pup near the Hollow, Shadow now guards her side with unwavering devotion and a quiet, wild wisdom.
