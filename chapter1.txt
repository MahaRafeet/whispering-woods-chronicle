On the edge of Elderglen, where the trees whispered louder than the people and the shadows moved like they had memories, twelve-year-old Ward unearthed a map hidden beneath a loose stone in her cottage floor. The parchment was impossibly old, inked with symbols that shimmered only when touched by moonlight—and bled red when near fire. At its center, a sigil of a twisted tree with hollow eyes pulsed like it was alive. The wind outside stilled. The birds stopped singing. And deep within the forest, something stirred. Ward didn’t know what the map led to—but she knew it had chosen her.
