On the edge of Elderglen, where the trees whispered louder than the people and the shadows moved like they had memories, twelve-year-old Ward unearthed a map hidden beneath a loose stone in her cottage floor. The parchment was impossibly old, inked with symbols that shimmered only when touched by moonlight—and bled red when near fire. At its center, a sigil of a twisted tree with hollow eyes pulsed like it was alive. The wind outside stilled. The birds stopped singing. And deep within the forest, something stirred. Ward didn’t know what the map led to—but she knew it had chosen her.

Elara crossed the threshold of the Whispering Woods as if stepping into another world. The moment her boots touched the moss-carpeted earth, the wind died, and the trees leaned inward, their branches curling like ancient fingers sharing secrets. Shafts of light filtered through the canopy in flickering gold, dancing over twisted roots and glistening ferns. A low, melodic hum echoed through the air—too rhythmic for wind, too soft for birdsong. Her breath caught in her throat. The forest wasn’t silent; it was listening. Every step forward felt like an invitation—and a test. Elara’s pulse quickened, not in fear, but in awe. The map burned faintly in her satchel, as if it, too, could feel the forest watching.
