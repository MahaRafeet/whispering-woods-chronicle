On the edge of Elderglen , where the trees whispered louder than the people and the shadows moved like they had memories,
twelve-year-old Ward unearthed a map hidden beneath a loose stone in her cottage floor. The parchment was impossibly old,
inked with symbols that shimmered only when touched by moonlight—and bled red when near fire.
At its center, a sigil of a twisted tree with hollow eyes pulsed like it was alive. The wind outside stilled. 
The birds stopped singing. And deep within the forest, something stirred. Ward didn’t know what the map led to—but she knew it had chosen her.

Elara unfolded the brittle parchment with trembling fingers, careful not to tear the ancient edges. Faded ink traced a winding path through landmarks she barely recognized—an old mill, 
a crooked elm, and a place ominously marked “The Hollow.” The lines pulsed with a strange energy, as if the map itself were alive. 
A single note was scrawled in the margin: *"Only the seeker with courage may find the heart of the forest."* Her pulse quickened. 
She glanced back toward the village, now bathed in the soft gold of dusk, and clutched the map tighter.

By morning, Elara had packed lightly—a loaf of bread, her father’s old compass, and the map rolled into a leather tube. The forest edge loomed ahead,
the trees whispering secrets only the wind could understand. She hesitated, the weight of her choice settling on her shoulders. But something deep inside urged her on,
stronger than fear or reason. With a steady breath, she stepped past the familiar path and into the unknown, leaves crunching softly beneath her boots.
The map had called her , and she was ready to answer. The map had called her, and she was ready to answer—though she had no idea what question awaited her.
