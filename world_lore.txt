1. The Language of Ancient Runes
The Ancient Runes are a lost temporal script, each symbol encoding moments in time rather than words. Only Chronomancers can decipher them, using the Cipher to unlock visions of the past or future. Misreading even one glyph can fracture timelines, making their mastery both revered and feared.

2. The Griffin of the Sky Peaks
The Griffin, part eagle, part lion, guards the Sky Peaks' temporal vortex. Its feathers shimmer with frozen seconds, and its roar can halt time. Loyal to no master, it tests any who seek the Cipherâ€™s summit, demanding proof of intent before granting passage through the clouds of time.
