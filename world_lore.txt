Carved into obsidian tablets, Ancient Runes are a forgotten language of timeweavers, activated through spoken cadence and intent. Each symbol channels temporal energy, allowing Chronomancers to bend seconds or centuries. Deciphering them requires attunement with the Cipher’s heartbeat, as mistranslation can fracture reality or summon echoes from lost timelines.
The Griffin, half-lion, half-eagle, rules the Sky Peaks with fierce majesty. Born of wind and lightning, it guards the Aeon Spire, where the Cipher’s core is hidden. Only those pure of purpose may pass; others face talons that slice through time itself, casting intruders into temporal maelstroms.
