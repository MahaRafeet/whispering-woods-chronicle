The Ancient Runes form a secret, arcane alphabet—etched by chronomancers onto stone and metal—that pulses with primal magic. Each symbol echoes divine origins: words of power granted by Odin himself. Carved in Futhark form, they bend time and fate when chanted correctly, weaving spells of prophecy and protection.
